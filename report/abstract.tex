We explain the implementation of an R-package extending the existing package \texttt{fdaPDE} [!dynamic link]. The extension implements an algorithm modelling a spatial field using regression with partial differential regression, as described in \cite{Bernardi} [!Bernardi]. The anisotropy matrix is estimated from the data. We explain our implementation and provide performance studies of our code.
